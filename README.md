# phase-field-models
This repo is for developing pf models from scratch and improving understanding from perspectives of mathematics, computer science and material science.

The principles of developing reusable, expandable, managable problems are:

- Do no repeat yourself 
  when a block of code are used in different places, put it in a sigle file and call it from other files
- Modularization
  This is for building new models more effectively and make degugging easier
